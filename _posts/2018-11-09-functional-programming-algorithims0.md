### Definitions

- **Functor**: structure preserving morphism between two categories.
- **Optics**: Computation that will yield value at a later time.
- **Disjuctions**: Computation that produces the disjuction of two values(ex: None or Some(b):Either[A,B])
- **Profucntor**: Relation between two types.
- **Partiality**: Computations that are non-total.


### Functor

Effects are an abstract computational concept.

```haskell

```

### Natural Transformation
